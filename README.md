basicNonInfinityResbonsiveCarousel
==================================
This is a module pattern implementation of a basic responsive carousel.
This is the first of the series on responsive modules that i will develope.
My target is to create diffrent modules that the one will include the other and throught their  namespace  i will add functionllities.
The next external  add on for that module will be the infinity functionality
